Instructions:
	Our project should be pretty self explanatory but if you are at all confused at how to work it look no further. 
		First go to localhost:8080. 
		There you should find our home page.
		Follow the prompts to choose a chatroom from the list or to create a new room.
		After choosing a room you should be brought to a page where you are asked to input a screen name to be displayed to the other chatters. Input your preferred name and click “Next”.
		You should then be brought to your chosen chatrooms page. Enter your message in the box located in the bottom left of your screen and click “Send” to submit it
		Happy Chatting!

Design:
	We decided to break our project into 2 pages, a home page and a screen name/chatroom page. The home page simply displays all the currently open chatrooms and gives the user the option of choosing an already open chatroom creating a new one. After they choose which chatroom they want, it will take them to a page where they are prompted for a screen name to chat under. After entering a screen name that page will disappear and be replaced with the actual chatroom where they can begin chatting.

Collaborators:
	Trevor Chase and Andy Wood

Bugs and Problems:
	There are two bugs in our program. The first is not exactly a bug as I don’t believe it has anything to do with our code. When you visit localhost:8080, the chatroom list sometimes appears empty. Simply refreshing the page fixes it and most of the time the list shows up the first time you go to the page. The second bug is that the first message that a person sends to the chatroom sometimes either has no nickname or it is just the first letter of the nickname. All the other messages that are sent have a nickname except for the first.

Extra Feature:
	We chose to implement a “back to room list” button on all chatroom pages so the user can easily return to the home page and switch chatrooms without having to retype the url.
